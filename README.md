# HomeAtmosphere

Little home project to get the home atmospheric data collected from arduino to my statusbar on OSX.

### Backend
Node with express.js
MongoDB as storage solution. // This could actually be done by a lightweight message protocol instead of data storage, but i wanted to learn more about mongodb :) 

### GUI
Made with python library "Rumps"

### Arduino
Used a NodeMCU 3.3 for collecting sensor data and posting it to the backend.
